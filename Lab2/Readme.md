## Welcome to LAB 2

In this LAB we are going to build a bot and connect it to a LUIS app that we will train to create a custum natural language dialog.

Contents of this folder:
* [LAB2.docx](https://github.com/Rubicon-BV/GlobalAzureBootcamp2018/blob/master/Lab2/Lab2.docx) contains the steps for the lab.
* [GAB2018BOT-Export.json](https://github.com/Rubicon-BV/GlobalAzureBootcamp2018/blob/master/Lab2/GAB2018BOT-Export.json) is a LUIS app export that you will build using the LAB.
* [Example Warranty Snippet.cs](https://github.com/Rubicon-BV/GlobalAzureBootcamp2018/blob/master/Lab2/Example%20Warranty%20Snippet.cs) contains the completed code example for step 3 in this LAB. 

Good luck with the LAB!

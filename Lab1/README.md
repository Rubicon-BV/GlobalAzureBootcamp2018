## LAB 1
This lab contains 5 steps:
1.	Create your own QnA Maker service
2. Utilize the QnA Maker API
3.	Connect your QnA Maker service to the Azure Bot Service 
4.	Enable your bot on multiple channels like Skype and Telegram

## 1. Create your own QnA Maker service

**Microsoft QnA Maker** is a free, easy-to-use, REST API and web-based service that trains AI to respond to user's questions in a more natural, conversational way. Compatible across development platforms, hosting services, and channels, QnA Maker is the only question and answer service with a graphical user interface—meaning you don’t need to be a developer to train, manage, and use it for a wide range of solutions.
With optimized machine learning logic and the ability to integrate industry-leading language processing with ease, QnA Maker distills masses of information into distinct, helpful answers.

## 2. Utilize the QnA Maker API
Each published QnA Maker service is exposed as an HTTP endpoint that will take in a question and respond back with the best matched answer and a confidence score. You need the following two GUIDs to access your knowledge base via the HTTP endpoint
* Knowledge Base ID: This is auto-generated by the system for every published KB.  
* Subscription Key: These are assigned per account, and is used for metering.
 
### 2.1 Postman

**Postman** is a popular API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. This is done by allowing users to create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses. 

**Requirement:** _You need to register an account to use Postman_
 
_Our second action is to run a request via Postman_
1. Go to [https://www.getpostman.com/apps](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)

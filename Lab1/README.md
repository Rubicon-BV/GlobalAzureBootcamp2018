## 1. Create your own QnA Maker service

**Microsoft QnA Maker** is a free, easy-to-use, REST API and web-based service that trains AI to respond to user's questions in a more natural, conversational way. Compatible across development platforms, hosting services, and channels, QnA Maker is the only question and answer service with a graphical user interface—meaning you don’t need to be a developer to train, manage, and use it for a wide range of solutions.
With optimized machine learning logic and the ability to integrate industry-leading language processing with ease, QnA Maker distills masses of information into distinct, helpful answers.

2. Click on **Create new service**.  
![Create new QnA Service0](https://github.com/Rubicon-BV/GlobalAzureBootcamp2018/blob/master/Lab1/Pics/CreateQnAService0.png)
3. Enter the **Name** of your service and the web page URL that contains your **FAQ** (you can also enter the questions and answers manually or you can upload a file with your questions and answers).  
![Create new QnA Service](https://github.com/Rubicon-BV/GlobalAzureBootcamp2018/blob/master/Lab1/Pics/CreateQnAService.png)
4. For example you could use the URL of the Azure Support FAQs: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/
5. The site will import the **FAQ**…  
![Create new QnA Service2](https://github.com/Rubicon-BV/GlobalAzureBootcamp2018/blob/master/Lab1/Pics/CreateQnAService2.png)
6. ...then display it in a FAQ database. You can edit the content of the database on this screen.  
![Create new QnA Service3](https://github.com/Rubicon-BV/GlobalAzureBootcamp2018/blob/master/Lab1/Pics/CreateQnAService3.png)
7. The test screen allows you to chat with the Bot who responds by retrieving the appropriate answer from the FAQ database. This screen allows you to train the Bot by indicating what answer the Bot should give to a particular question, or by supplying a new answer.  
![Create new QnA Service4](https://github.com/Rubicon-BV/GlobalAzureBootcamp2018/blob/master/Lab1/Pics/CreateQnAService4.png)
8. When you have completed training, click the **Save and retrain** button. Finally, click the **Publish** button.

## 2. Consume your QnA Maker service
Each published QnA Maker service is exposed as an HTTP endpoint that will take in a question and respond back with the best matched answer and a confidence score. You need the following two GUIDs to access your knowledge base via the HTTP endpoint
* Knowledge Base ID: This is auto-generated by the system for every published KB.  
* Subscription Key: These are assigned per account, and is used for metering.
 
### 2.1 Postman

**Postman** is a popular API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. This is done by allowing users to create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses. 

**Requirement:** _You need to register an account to use Postman_
 
_Our second action is to run a request via Postman_
1. Go to [https://www.getpostman.com/apps](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)

10. Copy the **POST URL** from _step 11_ in the previous chapter and paste this URL after the HOST URL in the Post Function within Postman.
11. Ensure **Inherith auth from parent** is selected as **Type** under the _Authorization_ tab.
12. Click on the **Headers** tab.
13. Enter the following key/value pairs (gathered from the generated input from step 11 in the previous chapter):

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key | …from step 1.11 |
| Content-Type | …from step 1.11 |
